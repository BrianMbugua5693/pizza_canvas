# pizza_canvas
A javascript library to build pizza with canvas

## About
- This library helps you to build a pizza with a drag and drop interface;
- I have disposed an api to access some commands of library, like:
    - set tray asset background
    - set number of slices
    - set asset to slice
    - remove asset from slice
    - preview a slice on mouse dragging over
    - identify slice by mouse position
    - clear assets

## No dependences is needed
Just open index.html on browser and see the magic happen.
